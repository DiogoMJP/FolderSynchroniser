# Overview
This program was created to allow for the simple synchronisation of the contents of computer directories; namely when wanting to keep a backup of work.

# Usage
There are four buttons that can be used to interact with this program:
1. **Open Directory:** this button, as the name implies, allows the user to select a directory to be opened and displayed in the main area of the window. Several directories can be opened in a row.
2. **Refresh Files:** recursively updates the contents of each directory that has been opened.
3. **Clear Selection:** removes the selection of all directories and resets the program to its initial state.
4. **Synchronise Files:** copies the most recent version of each file to the corresponding directory for all the selected directories.
